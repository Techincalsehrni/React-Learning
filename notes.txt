React -> 1. React+dom = for website   2. React+ Native = for mobile apps.


go to project for here
Method- 1 by creat app
######## It is not recommended as it takes long time make process slow 
To creat react app we execute comman -> npx create-react-app 01basicreact [but it will take longer time]
after above command execution there will be a many folders fetched. 1st entry point is "pacakage.json"
########
-> cd 01basicreact
-> npx run start   // IT will open react in browser where we can go to to view page source , in npm run start we are running start scipt available in package.json 
-> npx run build  // It will create a build folder which involves a static folder with content file  like html , css, js , in npm run build we are running build scipt available in package.json 


Method-2 by vite 
to create project  open command at root level
-> npm create vite@latest -> then choose project name , package name and framework.

### difrence b/w 1 and 2 method is that in 2 method we don't get node modules so whenever we don't have node modules folder we can download it by using command 
-> npm i  [all required pacakage will be downloaded]
// after installing node modules go to package.json and see there is script obj with dev value so for making project further.
-> npm run dev -> will give a url open it. 
// I get url but after cliking it there was an error so I asked chatgpt and it suggest to clear cache by doing fillowing :
//rm -rf node_modules
// npm install
// npm run dev

1.The createRoot create's its own DOM and then compare it with the web browser's DOM and only update those components which are actually updated.
2.But the browser removes the whole DOM and then recrates the whole DOM with the updated values this is called reload.
3. However virtual DOM tracks whole DOM like a tree like structure and updates only those values which were only changed.
4. But some values depends on network call so if we update a value it might get update immediately via a network call.
5. So we will have to update it again. To avoid this overhead we can drop the updation calls for the immediate value update.
6. The current algo used by the React is called the React Fibre algo.
7. The algo react uses to differentiate updated virtual dom and previous dom  through create root is called reconciliation.
8. Reconciliation is the algo behind what popularly known as the Virtual-DOM.
9.In UI it is not necessary for every update to be applied immediately.
10. So to avoid the immeediately updates, React Fibre helps to pause work, abort it, assign prorities, reuse previously completed work.

React props -: to send data from one component to another.

Props are sent inside the component brackets.
eg. <Card channel = "chaiaurcode"/> 
1 Always use curly brackets for a variable { variableName } to send it as props.
Props can be in any form but passed as a variable.
eg. <Card username = "chaiaurcode"/> 
eg. <Card object = "myobject"/> 
eg. <Card array = "myarray"/> 

2 props send the data in the object form to the component.
so to access ->
                   props.properties or {properties ="defaultValue if props doesn't receive any value"}
eg.props.username


#########################
When we write setCounter(counter+1) multiple times it is updated only once because in the onclick handler of that render, even after calling setCounter(counter + 1) multiple times the value of the counter is 15, because after our event handler finishes, then React re-renders the component in batch. 
where
when we use callback() function inside setterMethod() because the settermethod() returns a updatedvar which is accepted by callback is modified one that's why we are able to increment the variable 4 times.
setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter +1)


#################
The on click method in React expects a function reference
You can't directly pass parameters inside the function, instead, you need to pass it as a reference or use arrow function syntax
